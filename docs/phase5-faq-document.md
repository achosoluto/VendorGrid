## General Information

### Q1: What is changing with the authentication system?

- **New Features:** Two-factor authentication, better session management
- **Future-Ready:** Foundation for additional integrations and features

### Q3: How long will the migration take?
**A:** The migration is designed to be seamless:
- **Preparation Phase:** Already completed (no user action needed)
- **Migration Phase:** Gradual rollout starting November 15, 2025

### Q4: Will I need to download any new software?
**A:** No, this is entirely web-based. Simply continue using VendorGrid as you normally would through your web browser. No downloads, installations, or browser updates are required.

### Q5: Is this change mandatory?
**A:** Yes, this system upgrade is mandatory for all users as it replaces the underlying authentication infrastructure. However, the transition is designed to be seamless, and most users won't notice any difference in their daily workflow.
