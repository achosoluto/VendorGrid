3. **Regular Updates:**
   - Consider changing your password every 6-12 months

## Account Security Features

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) - Optional

**What is 2FA?**

3. **Complete Setup:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions
   - Test the setup to ensure it works
   - Save backup codes in a safe place

#### Benefits of 2FA

- **Enhanced Security:** Even if someone gets your password, they still need the second factor
- **Protection Against Hacking:** Prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised
- **Peace of Mind:** Extra layer of protection for your sensitive vendor data
